Django's application for handling privacy and cookie policies configured with Iubenda.

---

## Requirements

These packages are required:

-   Python +3.8 supported.
-   Django +3.2 supported.

We **highly recommend** and only officially support the latest patch release of each Python and Django series.


## Installation

1. Install from **pip**:
```shell
pip install django-iubenda
```

2. Modify `settings.py` by adding the app to `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    "modeltranslation",
    # ...
    "iubenda",
    # ...
)
```

3. Modify `settings.py` by adding the app's context processor to `TEMPLATES`:
```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        # ...
        "OPTIONS": {
            "context_processors": [
                # ...
                "iubenda.context_processors.iubenda",
                # ...
            ],
        },
    },
]
```

4. Be sure the Django's Locale middleware is enabled inside `settings.py`:
```python
MIDDLEWARE = (
    # ...
    "django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware",
    # ...
)
```

5. Modify `url.py` by adding the app's urls to `urlpatterns`:
```python
urlpatterns += [
    path("", include("iubenda.urls")),
]
```

6. Modify `url.py` by adding the app's sitemaps to `sitemaps`:
```python
from iubenda.sitemaps import PrivacySitemap, CookieSitemap

sitemaps = {
    # ...
    "privacy": PrivacySitemap,
    "cookie": CookieSitemap,
    # ...
}
```

7. Be sure the variable `LANGUAGE_CODE` is available for HTML templates:
```html
{% load i18n %}
{% get_current_language as LANGUAGE_CODE %}
```

8. Modify your project's template to add privacy and cookie policies.
   For example inside the `footer.html` add following code:
```html
{% if not debug %}
    {% block iubenda %}{% include "iubenda/include-content.html" %}{% endblock iubenda %}
{% endif %}
```

## Optional

### Content Security Policy
If Content Security Policy are implemented in your server and inline scripts are disabled,
the variable `IUBENDA_CSP_NONCE` can be set with nonce tag will be inserted script's nonce.
```html
<script type="text/javascript" {% if cx_iubenda_nonce %}nonce="{{ cx_iubenda_nonce }}"{% endif %}>
```
Inside your webserver's configurations, a rule to dynamically replace your CONSTANT nonce in a random string is needed.

To allow  external source from Iubenda domains, please implement these rules:
```editorconfig
Content-Security-Policy:
    script-src-elem https://*.iubenda.com";
    img-src https://*.iubenda.com data:";
    style-src https://*.iubenda.com";
    connect-src https://*.iubenda.com";
    frame-src https://*.iubenda.com";
```

If you prefer to not allow ***unsafe-inline*** inside your CSP, please also add the two specific hash for your
script prompted as error in Javascript Console.
```editorconfig
# Iubenda Privacy And Cookie Policy - API
Content-Security-Policy:
    ...
    script-src-elem https://*.iubenda.com 'sha256-YOUR-FIRST-HASH-PROMPTED-INSIDE-CONSOLE' 'sha256-YOUR-SECOND-HASH-PROMPTED-INSIDE-CONSOLE';
    ...
```

### Iubenda's Options

To personalize the Iubenda script's behaviour, the dict `IUBENDA_OPTIONS` can be configured inside `settings.py`
```python
IUBENDA_OPTIONS = {
    "ccpaAcknowledgeOnDisplay": "true",
    "ccpaApplies": "true",
    "consentOnContinuedBrowsing": "false",
    "enableCcpa": "true",
    "floatingPreferencesButtonDisplay": "bottom-left",
    "invalidateConsentWithoutLog": "true",
    "perPurposeConsent": "true",
    "whitelabel": "false",
    "banner": {
        "acceptButtonDisplay": "true",
        "backgroundOverlay": "true",
        "closeButtonRejects": "true",
        "customizeButtonDisplay": "true",
        "explicitWithdrawal": "true",
        "fontSize": "14px",
        "listPurposes": "true",
        "position": "float-center",
        "rejectButtonDisplay": "true",
    },
}
```

### Integration with Google Tag Manager
If Google Tag Manager is implemented in your application and all needed settings were configured inside the container,
the variable `IUBENDA_GTM` can be set with the value `True` and the Iubenda's callback will be inserted inside the script.

For needed configuration inside Google Tag Manager container, please refer to these notes:
* [Google Consent Mode](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/27137-google-consent-mode)
* [Google Consent Mode setup GTM with Iubenda](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/74198-google-consent-mode-set-up-google-tag-manager-with-iubenda)
* [GTM Blocking Cookies](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/1235-google-tag-manager-blocking-cookies)
